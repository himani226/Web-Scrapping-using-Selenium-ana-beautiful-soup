Web scraping is an automated method used to extract large amounts of data from websites.

The data found on websites are often unstructured.Web scraping is a technique to collect that unstructured data and store it in structured form.

When any web scraping code is run the request is sent to the URL that you have mentioned. The website responds to the request by sending data and allows it to read the XML or HTML page. The code will then extract the required data from that XML or HTML page.

Any web scraping code you need to follow the basic steps:
1. Find the URL(address) of web page you want to scrape
2. Inspect the page and find the data you want to extract
3. Write the logic for extracting the data
4. Store extracted data into structured form(E.g. Pandas DataFrame)
